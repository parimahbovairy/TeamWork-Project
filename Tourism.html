            Niagara Falls, waterfall on the Niagara River in northeastern North
            America, one of the continent’s most<br />
            famous spectacles. The falls lie on the border between Ontario,
            Canada, and New York state, U.S. For many<br />
            decades the falls were an attraction for honeymooners and for such
            stunts as walking over the falls on<br />
            a tightrope or going over them in a barrel. Increasingly, however,
            the appeal of the site has become<br />
            its beauty and uniqueness as a physical phenomenon.

            "The Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World" was a gift of
            friendship from the people of France to the<br />
            United States and is recognized as a universal symbol of freedom and
            democracy. The Statue of<br />
            Liberty was dedicated on October 28, 1886. It was designated as a
            National Monument in 1924.<br />
            Employees of the National Park Service have been caring for the
            colossal copper statue since 1933.

              One of the most famous landmarks in the United Kingdom, Stonehenge
              is regarded as a British cultural icon.<br />It has been a legally
              protected Scheduled Ancient Monument since 1882, when legislation
              to protect historic monuments was<br />
              first successfully introduced in Britain. The site and its
              surroundings were added to UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites
              in 1986.<br />
              Stonehenge is owned by the Crown and managed by English Heritage;
              the surrounding land is owned by the National Trust.
